# Buoys and lights
## Lights
* The default light colour is white
* The time dictates the time taken for one sequence
* Occulting - Occ - on for longer than it's off
* Group occulting - Occ(n) - must occult twice over the time period
* Isophase - Iso - on for as long as it's off
* Flashing - FI - flashes that are quick (Q), very quick (VQ) or ultra quick (UQ)
* Group flashing - FI(n) - groups of flashes followed by darkness
* Always on - F - continuous light
## Buoys
### Intro
* There are 12 buoys in total
* Must be able to recognise buoys by:
  - Purpose
  - Shape
  - Colour
  - Light
### IALA regions
* There are two regions, A and B
* Lateral markers differ between regions:
  - In A flat reds to port and pointy greens to starboard
  - in B flat greens to port and pointy reds to starboard
### Lateral markters
* Purpose: Marks safe channel
* Shape:
  - Port - flat top
  - Starboard - pointy top
* Colour:
  - Depends on IALA region
  - In IALA A, port is red and starbord is green
  - In IALA A, port is green and starbord is red
* Lights:
  - Any red sequence other than 2+1
  - Any green sequence other than 2+1
  - Defining many possible sequences is useful to be able to tell them apart so that you can tell where you are in the channel
### Cardinal markers
* Purpose: Marks north, south, east and west boundaries of danger
* Shape:
  * Defined by orientation of two triangles on top of buoy
  * North - both triangles pointing up
  * South - both pointing down
  * East - pointing away from each other
  * West - pointing towards
* Colour:
  * General rule is arrows always point towards black
  * North - black then yellow
  * South - yellow then black
  * East - black, yellow, black
  * West - yellow, black, yellow
* Lights:
  - Similar to a clock in terms of number of flashes
  - North - continuous flashes, could be any length
  - South - 6 flashes plus one long flash, could be any length
  - East - 3 flashes, could be any length
  - West - 9 flashes, could be any length
### Isolated danger mark
* Purpose: Sits on top of danger - give wide berth
* Shape: Two balls on top
* Colour: Red and black
* Lights
  - Best remembered by 'Go away', or 'eff off'
  - 2 white flashes in some sequence
### Safe water mark/Fairway buoy
* Purpose: Marks the point when you are clear of stuff that needs careful consideration eg. When coming out of a river and into open water. Coming from the other direction it marks the point at which more careful navigation is required.
* Shape: Round top mark
* Colour: Red and white stripes
* Lights: Isophase white or occulting white, or morse A (Mo A) which is short then long
### Special marker
* Purpose: Various miscellaneous purposes such as marking out race boundaries, radar testing/fixing etc.
* Shape: X on top
* Colour: Yellow
* Lights:
  - Yellow or orange (usually quite feeble)
  - Any flash other than the ones used of the other buoys, could be FI(4), 1+something etc.
### Emergency wreck buoy
* Marks a new wreck
* Shape: Cross top mark
* Colour: Blue and yellow
* Light: On for 1s in blue, off for half a second, on for 1s in yellow, off for half a second
### Preferred channel markers
* Where a channel splits it marks the preferred route. You can take the other one as well but the other channel is better.
  - Starboard: Port channel is the preferred route
  - Port: Starboard channel is the preferred route
* Lights:
  - Starboard: Green 2+1
  - Port: Red 2+1
* Shape:
  - Starboard: Triangle top mark
  - Port: Flat top mark
* Colour:
  - Starboard: Green, red then green
  - Port: Red, green then red
### Other Notes
- the Reed's skippers handbook is a good book to have to be able to identify buoys and a range of other useful stuff
