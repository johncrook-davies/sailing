# Buoyage
## Light sequences and notation
* The default light colour is white
* The time dictates the time taken for one sequence
* Occulting - Occ - on for longer than it's off
* Group occulting - Occ(n) - must occult twice over the time period, note that for groups of occulting sequences
* Isophase - Iso - on for as long as it's off
* Flashing - FI - flashes that are quick (Q), very quick (VQ) or ultra quick (UQ)
* Group flashing - FI(n) - groups of flashes followed by darkness
* Always on - F - continuous light
* Small 'm' denotes the height of the light (above MHWS)
* Big 'M' denotes nautical miles and represents the distance from which the light is visible
* Two colours concatenated together eg 'WR' for white and red, denotes a light that has two filters that are visible from different sectors - this sort of light might mark out a safe channel where a 'safe', 'white' sector is sandwiched between red and green lights. These lights often have a number of visibility distances to match the number of colours, separated by a '/', in the same order as the colours.
## List of buoys: Shapes, colours and lights
### Intro
* There are 12 buoys in total
* Must be able to recognise buoys by:
  - Purpose
  - Shape
  - Colour
  - Light
### IALA regions
* There are two regions, A and B
* Lateral markers differ between regions:
  - In A flat reds to port and pointy greens to starboard
  - in B flat greens to port and pointy reds to starboard
### Lateral markters
* Purpose: Marks safe channel
* Shape:
  - Port - flat top
  - Starboard - pointy top
* Colour:
  - Depends on IALA region
  - In IALA A, port is red and starboard is green
  - In IALA A, port is green and starboard is red
* Lights:
  - Any red sequence other than 2+1
  - Any green sequence other than 2+1
  - Defining many possible sequences is useful to be able to tell them apart so that you can tell where you are in the channel
### Cardinal markers
* Purpose: Marks north, south, east and west boundaries of danger
* Shape:
  * Defined by orientation of two triangles on top of buoy
  * North - both triangles pointing up
  * South - both pointing down
  * East - pointing away from each other
  * West - pointing towards
* Colour:
  * General rule is arrows always point towards black
  * North - black then yellow (BY)
  * South - yellow then black (YB)
  * East - black, yellow, black (BYB)
  * West - yellow, black, yellow (YBY)
* Lights:
  - Similar to a clock in terms of number of flashes
  - North - continuous flashes, could be any length
  - South - 6 flashes plus one long flash, could be any length
  - East - 3 flashes, could be any length
  - West - 9 flashes, could be any length
### Isolated danger mark
* Purpose: Sits on top of danger - give wide berth, no agreed distance for this, just common sense
* Shape: Two balls on top
* Colour: Black, red and black (BRB)
* Lights
  - Best remembered by 'Go away', or 'eff off'
  - 2 white flashes in some sequence
### Safe water mark/Fairway buoy
* Purpose: Marks the point when you are clear of stuff that needs careful consideration eg. When coming out of a river and into open water. Coming from the other direction it marks the point at which more careful navigation is required.
* Shape: Round top mark
* Colour: Red and white stripes (RW)
* Lights: Isophase white or occulting white, or morse A (Mo A) which is short then long, or long flash
### Special marker
* Purpose: Various miscellaneous purposes such as marking out race boundaries, radar testing/fixing etc.
* Shape: X on top
* Colour: Yellow
* Lights:
  - Yellow or orange (usually quite feeble)
  - Any flash other than the white flashes used by the other buoys, could be FI(4), 1+something etc.
### Emergency wreck buoy
* Marks a new wreck
* Shape: Cross top mark
* Colour: Blue and yellow (BU.Y)
* Light: On for 1s in blue, off for half a second, on for 1s in yellow, off for half a second
### Preferred channel markers
* Where a channel splits it marks the preferred route. You can take the other one as well but the other channel is better. Colour denends on where the channel is, not where you leave it (as for lateral markers)
  - Port: Port channel is the preferred route
  - Starboard: Starboard channel is the preferred route
* Lights:
  - Port: Green 2+1
  - Starboard: Red 2+1
* Shape:
  - Port: Triangle top mark
  - Starboard: Flat top mark
* Colour:
  - Port:
    - For IALA A: Green, red then green (GRG)
    - For IALA B: Red, green then red (RGR)
  - Starboard:
    - For IALA A: Red, green then red (RGR)
    - For IALA B: Green, red then green (GRG)
### Other Notes
- the Reed's skippers handbook is a good book to have to be able to identify buoys and a range of other useful stuff
