# Tides

## Terminology
* Tides that are acting against our course in any way are described as 'foul' tides.
* South going tides come from the south (contrary to the direction of wind), north going tides come from the north etc.

## What effects them
* Neap tides are when the moon and the sun are acting on the earth at a perpendicular angle
* Spring tides are when the moon and the sun are either both on the same side of the earth or on opposite sides
* Neap and spring tides therefore alternate around 7 days between each (28 days for a full cycle)
* The strength of neap and spring tides is affected by the apogee and perigee of the moon.
  - Tidal ranges peak when The moon is at perigee
* There are a number of places that you can get tidal information from:
  - You can get tidal heights from tidal guages (there's one in the entrance to Portsmouth and at Cowes)
  - Harbour websites (such as Bembridge) may have live tidal information
  - Tidal apps such as UKHO's EasyTide
* Mean sea level pressure is 1013.5mb
  - This means that the tide changes by 1cm per mb difference to mean sea level pressure
  - Storm surges occur when it is a springs tide and the pressure is very low
* Wind also affects tides, wind blowing towards land increases the tide closer to the land and wind blowing away from land decreases the tide closer to the land

## Using an Almanac
* Almanacs are specific to each calendar year
* Inside page shows the chart covered by the almanac
* There's loads of information on the first few pages covering a number of different bits
* The next pages cover abbreviations use in the almanac
* The next pages have tables of lights giving:
  - abbreviations
  - length of flashes
* The next page has chart symbol definitions (a more comprehensive list can be found in the 5011)
* Next page shows springs etc
* A 'tidal gate' is a place where the tide is very strong which is a problem for slow boats or 'craft'
* Very important to read almanacs when planning pilotage
### Tidal directions
* The next pages show tidal directions
* The first number is the speed at neeps
* The second number is the
### Tidal stream diagrams
  - Shows direction of tide at high water
  - Left number is speed of tide for spring tide in knots
  - Right is speed of neap tide in
  - 'Tidal diamonds'
### Description of each section
* The first pages have important local information
* Then there are details of the lights in the areas
* Then there are individual sections with more information like
  - berths in harbour
  - where is good anchoring
  - which bits are sheltered
  - pilotage notes - which basically tell you exactly how to pilot into a  harbour eg. Stay port of SCM (south cardinal marker), keep SCM in view in between break waters on approach.
  - depths are all defined as at chart datum
  - radio details - what channel VTS is in, what channel the marina is on (usually 80), what channel is the emergency channel - used for initial contact and maydays (always 16)
  - facilities - a list of facilities ususally all abreviated
* Tidal information 365 days worth including:
  - time zone (UT == GMT) including any adjustments to get to local seasonal time ie. daylight savings time (DST). Times are defined counter intuitively as being minus x hours for timezones that are x hours ahead of UT/GMT. The times in the almanac are as at the timezone stated. For the training charts, containting the Northern Territories and Southern Pensinsula, the defined timezones are UT, NTDST, Time Zone -0100, SPDST
  - times and heights above chart datum
  - On neap days the range is very small (if it's a half moon)
  - On springs days the range is very large (if it's a full moon)
  - Smaller places and less important locations ('secondary ports') have a small table that relates to one of the larger 365 days  
* Tidal height curve
  - For working out the tide at any time of day given the low and high water
  - Mean springs is the average springs tide for the whole year
  - It can be a bell curve or an upside down bell curve depending on whether it is based on the high water or low water tides
### Rising/dipping distances
  * If you know the height of the light, this is distance at which a light goes from being a 'lume' of light to an actual visible light source
  * By taking a fix of the light, you can use these distances to do a fix on the chart
  * Heights on the chart are defined as at Mean High Water Springs (MHWS)

## Getting the tidal height for any time of day
  1. depending on whether the curve for the area is HW reference or LW, get the time for the nearest HW/LW
  2. fill in the times under the curve
    - thick lines on chart are hours, thin lines are 10 mins
    - for eb tides use the section of the curve going from HW to LW, for flood tides go in the other direction
  3. mark the high water and low water tides on the chart
  4. join the high water and low water marks with a straight line
  5. find the curve that is to be used on the tidal range:
    - the difference between the red and blue curves are is the difference between springs and neaps tides
    - for tidal ranges between the tidal range, interpolate between the two curves
    - for tidal ranges on or above the mean HWS/HWN/LWS/LWN use the exact red or blue lines for springs or neaps respectively

## Getting the time when a specific height of tide will occur
Used for clearance or to ensure safe depth.
  1. follow steps 1-4 above
  2. draw a straight line from the required tide to the line
  3. draw a horizontal line to the relevant part of the curve (determined in step 1 part 2)
  4. draw a vertical line down to the time

## Tidal streams
* the 'set' or 'direction' of the tide is the direction that the tide is flowing
* the 'drift' or 'rate' of the tide is the speed
### Sources for tidal stream information:
#### the almanac
* has a diagram of the tidal streams where the tidal streams are represented by arrows,
* each arrow has two figures separated by a dot
  - the smaller number is the speed in knots at neaps and;
  -  the larger number is the speed in knots at springs (each number is actually a decimal)
* the direction of the stream can be worked out by using the plotter directly on the page (as would be done on the chart) - must use the frame of the page to get a straight line for the plotter
* information is good for half an hour either side of the time referenced at the top (eg high water, one hour after high water etc.)
#### the chart
* find the nearest tidal diamond to your location
* at the top of the chart there is a table showing the directions and speeds of tide
* for charts, the tidal streams table is usually defined referencing one of the major ports on the chart
* often there is no diamond in the place where you need it, and in this case you need to go look at the almanac instead
### Working out tidal direction using the almanac
1. find the times of the HW and LW that stradle the time range that you'd like the tidal stream information for
2. find the range between HW and LW and compare that to springs and neaps to figure out where you are in that range
3. work out how many hours before or after high water you are - the tidal stream information is good for half an hour either side of
4. use this to find the right page in the almanac or right row in the tidal information table at the top of the chart
5. if using the almanac, once you've fouind the right page, measure the bearing of the tidal stream and get the relevant speed from the number on the right side of the decimal place
6. write answer as "set {bearing} drift {speed}"

## Secondary ports (will not apear on exam)
* table in the almanac gives:
  - the standard port to use as a reference when working out HOT
  - the differences in HW times
  - the HW times that those differences are relevant for
  - same for LW
  - MHWS, MHWN, MLWN and MLWS
  - the differences to those heights
* work out the HOT in a secondary port
  1. get relevant high tide and low tide, and times - stay in UT for the moment
  2. work out range and determine whether range is:
    - neaps
    - springs
    - % springs
  3. for HW time, interpolate between HW times in secondary port table to get the number of minutes/hours difference (do interpolation - or perhaps extrapolation in minutes)
  4. interpolate between the MHWS values to get the height difference at the specific height (normal interpolation/extrapolation)
  5. do the same for LW (normal interpolation/extrapolation)
  6. using interpolated figures, convert HW time, HW height and LW height to secondary port figures
  7. carry out normal HOT process with standard port tidal curve
