# Charts

##  Important components and markings
* Most charts have 'spot depths' that are in meters, some are in feet
* The 'spot depths' are depths in the 'chart datum' scenario
* 'chart datum' is lowest astronomical tide or 'zero tide', not the same as low tide, this is when tidal information is zero
* Colour schemes change from chart to chart depending on manufacturer
* On Admiralty charts after the zero contour, 'drying heights' or bits that stick out of the water at zero tide have a line under the number
* Small numbers are decimal places
- Some areas have larger scale charts that are marked with an 'outline'
- The outlines have a reference in the corner that refers to a larger scale 'chartlet' you always want the largest scale chart possible
- The charts have magenta notes that have extra information on restrictions
- In the top right of the chart there is a 'source data' section which shows when each bit of the chart was measured and how - gives an idea of reliability
- Broken contour lines means unlikely to be reliable
- The 'compass rose' is used for two things, it is used for both parallel rules and to tell us what the difference is between true north and magnetic north is, or the 'magnetic variation'
- 'vertical clearance heights' are defined as a number with a line above and a line below with arrows or lines pointing to number
- squiggly lines are called 'overfalls' which are choppy water
- there are arrows that are defined as 'direction of boyage where not obvious' which shows the direction that you need to be going in to interpret the bouys
* There are other arrows that define traffic zones
- At the bottom of the chart it has
 - the name of the chart
 - details of the scale
 - details of units (m is meters, M is nautical miles)
 - it will also define vertical clearance heights which are defined as at 'heighest astronomical tide' ('HAT'), the tide will never be less than that
 - there is also a small table of tidal heights but there is a bigger one in the almanac
 - it defines navigation mark (IALA - international assosiation of lighthouse authorities) for coming into port
* The bottom left of the chart has a 'Notice to Mariners' which defines the last correction to the chart applied. You can use this to go to the UKHO (UK Hydrographic Organisation) website ro look for charg corrections since that date. Find the relevant changes by finding changes that are after the notice to mariners version number. You can then draw these in with a magenta pen. Alternatively there might be a piece of chart to glue on top of the current chart
* Maintained depths are shown as x.xm but spot depths are shown as X x.
## Projections
### 'Mercator'
Mercator was a Belgian that figured out a formula to represent a spherical grid on a flat piece of paper. Placing a light in the center of a globe, this would be the shadow cast by the land and lines of longitude and lattitude, of a piece of paper were wrapped around the equator. This means that as you get closer to the pole land masses get bigger. For the same reason, the scale is defined only at a certain lattitude oin the chart. The shortest distance between two points on this chart is called a 'Great Circle' and is curved.
### 'Transverse Mercator'
Used for large scale, small area charts. This is where the piece of paper is wrapped round the other way, from pole to pole. This is accurate around the meridian that it is based on and then there is distortion the further away from that meridian you go.
### 'Gnomonic projection' or 'UPS' (won't be tested on for day skipper)
The projection that would be cast if a flat piece of paper is illuminated by the light from a globe. Gnomonic the light is in the center of the globe. UPS the light is at the top of the globe. These are used for ocean crossings. A straight line (Rhumb line) on this projection is the shortest distance between two points.
## Latitude and longitude
* On a chart - numbers of longitude and latitude can be written in places that seem a bit random
* Latitude:
  - Lines of latitude are called parallels
  - Left and right scales on a chart
  - For a position on the planet, the angle between this place and the equator
  - 90 degrees above the equator and 90 degrees below, north is denoted by an 'N' eg. '45 degrees N' and south is denoted by 'S'
  - 1 degree of latitude is 60 Nm
  - 1 Nm is 1852m
  - Degrees of latitude are broken down into 60 minutes
  - 1Nm per minute, minute symbol is ' similar to a foot
  - 1/10 Nm is termed a cable
  - Minutes are broken down into decimal places of a minute (GPS units use 3dp)
* Longitude
  - On a chart you can tell which hemisphere you are in by which direction the degrees/minutes are increasing
  - Longitudinal lines are called Meridians
  - Top and bottom scales on a chart are longitude
  - 0 degrees is the Prime Meridian which is in Greenwich
  - For a position on the planet this is the angle between the Prime Meridian and the position
  - Longitudes are shown as a 3 digit number followed by the direction which is either 'W' or 'E'
  - Again degrees are broken down into 60 minutes
  - Minutes are broken down into decimal places of a minute (GPS units use 3dp)
  - 180 degrees west is the same as 180 degrees east (this is the international date line)
  - Longitude cannot be translated into distance because it is completely different at the poles compared to the equator
## Measuring distances and bearings
* Measuring distance on a chart:
  1. Split dividers so that one end is on the first point and the other end is on the second point that you are Measuring
  2. With the dividers fixed in that position, place them against the latitude scale to measure the number of Nm
  3. Make sure you use a latitude scale that is parallel to the area on the chart that you're measuring on (because of Mercator).
* Finding a position on the chart for a given lat and long:
  1. Use plotter to align to lat, draw a line in a rough position (parallel to lines of lattitude) - to get it parallel bridge between two lines of latitude. Or alternatively align the grid lines of the plotter to the scale at the edge of the chart.
  2. Use plotter to align to long, draw a line
  3. (optional) You can also use the plotter to draw a line using the latitude lines and then use the dividers to get the distance between the line of longitude and the distance.
* Using a plotter
  - Has a compass rose that spins around a straight edge
  - To use it to measure the bearing between two points:
    1. Align edge of plotter between two points on the chart, with blue arrow pointing in direction of bearing
    2. Spin compass rose until the two blue arrows point upwards - use the gridlines on the compass rose to to align them to lat or long gridlines on the chart
    3. Read off the heading from where the zero is
  - To use it to see where a course is going to take you
    1. Spin the compass rose so that the zero is pointing to the direction that you are currently going
    2. On the compass rose align the arrows so they are pointing upwards, use the grid on the compass rose to align with lat and long lines to get it parallel
    3. Align the edge of the ruler with position that you're currently at
    4. This is the straight line course that you are currently tracing
