# Weather
## Intro
* knowing about the weather allows you to be able to:
  - reduce wide area forecast into a local one
  - extend timescales of forecast
  - make predictions that weather forecast has missed
* what creates weather:
  - light is reflected or absorbed at the surface of the planet
  - rock turns light into heat and remits
  - plants absorb light and give back less heat
  - water and ice reflects light

## Gas dynamics
* weather behaviour is governed by laws of gas dynamics
* molecules are always in constant motion
* molecule interactions create the concept we know as pressure
* more heat -> faster molecules -> more pressure
* behaviour governed by gas law: PV = NT
  - N is quantity of gas
  - P is pressure
  - V is volume
  - T is temperature
* one consequence of this law is that T ~ P, so hot air is lower pressure than cold air
* pressure at the surface of the earth is much higher than pressure at higher altitudes, this is because at the surface of the earth, there is a far greater volume of gas weighing down
* this means that hot air floats on cold air

## Adiabatic effect
* warm air rising, cooling, and then falling is called convection
* this process happens as follows:
  - air pressure decreases with height this means that hit air rises
  - as air rises it expands
  - the expansion of the air as it rises uses energy which cools it
  - the air rises at a decreasing rate before falling
* most weather takes place in the troposphere where large convection currents exist

## Coriolis effect
* the earth rotates
* objects move in a straight line unless acted on by a force
* at the poles, air appears to curve as it moves from one place to another, it is actually moving in a straight line, this is the Coriolis effect
* this effect is much reduced at the equator where there is less relative motion

## Sea breazes
* during daytime:
  1. the land heats up
  2. air over the land is heated and rises
  3. as it rises it expands and cools (the adiabatic effect)
  4. it expands over the sea
  5. eventually it cools so much it falls again onto the sea
* at night the process is reversed
* drainage winds can exaggerate this effect further at night, this is where cool air flows down hill (can be exaggerated by snow covered mountains)

## Suns effect on earth
* more of the sun's energy hits the equator than the poles
* the equator is therefore heated to a greater extent than the poles
* if the earth was spinning very slowly the equator vs poles would create a convection current
* because of the earth is spinning it doesn't go in a straight line and actually spirals
* these spirals create two cells in each hemisphere and one on the equator
* this creates 5 bands moving from north to south Low, High, Low, High, Low
* in the northern hemisphere, southerly winds back, backing - is when the wind changes in an anticlockwise direction
* in the southern hemisphere, southerly winds veer, veering - is when the wind changes in a clockwise direction
* friction slows the wind down and therefore increases the Coriolis effect and the amount the wind backs
* this is additionally disrupted by the monsoon in the east

## Global air masses
* air inherits the characteristics of the ground it moves over
* in the UK, air coming from different directions are named according to their characteristics
  - North: Polar - cold
  - East: Continental - dry
  - South: Tropical - hot
  - West: Maritime - passed over water and therefore moist

## Fronts
### General
* fronts are the boundary of two air masses
* fronts are associated with rapid changes in pressure and weather
* in general, fronts behave according to certain rules
  - cold air forces warm air upwards
  - cold fronts are faster than warm fronts
  - cold fronts are steeper than warm fronts
### Depressions
* sometimes there is an imbalance and one air mass circulation flows into another
* this is often a 'warm tongue' moving into cold front and typically behaves as follows:
  1. warm wet air is pushed up and cools down on one side (the side on which the front is moving)
  2. at the other side (the back of the front (??)) cooler air moves into the void
  3. the colder air moves faster than the warm air
  4. cold fronts undercut the warm air, cooling the warm air and producing clouds and rain
  5. as the cold air is filling the void it is subject to the Coriolis effect which means it doesn't move in a straight line and creates a spiral
  6. as the cold ait catches up with itself the warm air is forced upwards creating more cloud and rain before fizzling out
* Atlantic lows nearly always move from West to East
* where you are in the depression and where the depression is in relation to the circulating air affects wind and weather experienced
* in the Northern Hemisphere:
  - high pressure points are anti-cyclones
  - high pressure flows outwards
  - this is deflected by the Coriolis effect
  - lows have winds that move anticlockwise around isobars, typically angled around 20 degrees to the isobars
  - highs have winds that move clockwise around isobars, typically angled around 20 degrees to the isobars
* first sign of an approaching front is high clouds
* cold fronts produce more dramatic weather because the front moves faster and is more steep
* cold fronts are associated with towering cumulus
* unstable clouds in wake of cold front produce smaller cumulus clouds

## Clouds
* if moist air is cooled, the moisture condenses and creates fog or cloud
* moist air cools more slowly than dry air
* air can be cooled by rising (sea breaze, hils, fronts)
* above 7000m water can only exist as ice crystals - clouds at this level have names beginning with 'syr'
* below 7000m its 'strato'
* clouds below 5000m are generically called 'cumulus'#
* these terms are combined at intermediate levels
* cumulus are associated with rapid vertical movement and are unstable
* Summer haze is dusty or polluted air

## Rain
* small droplets can grow into big ones by coalescence by bumping into each other
* most rain comes from clouds high up in the atmosphere
* super cooler liquid + ice crystals = snow which turns into rain as it hits warmer air

## Fog
* cloud at surface level - water vapour condensed by contact with cooler surface
  - radiation fog - forms at night - forms over land but drifts out to sea
  - hill fog - caused by cooling when air flows over hills and it cooled - typically burnt off by sun over time
  - sea fog - caused by warm air flowing over cooler water - common in early spring - more likely over rougher water - does not get blown off by sun - is perpetuated by sea
* arctic sea smoke - basically just steam, warm water interacting with cooler air, not just confined to the Arctic

## Weather maps
* surface analysis chart shows pressure and fronts
  - isobars are pressure contours
  - fronts are curved lines
    - warm fronts are labelled with blobs
    - cold fronts labelled with spikes
    - occluded fronts have both
* forecast chart is a prediction of surface chart
* rules of thumb
  - depressions move parallel to isobars
  - occludeded fronts move slower than non-occluded
  - closer isobars means fronts are likely to accelerate
  - the velocity of a front should be similar to what the velocity has been in the past
  - winds can sometimes be worked out using a defined scale on a chart
  - wind direction at high level is parallel to isobars
    - skewed by 20 degrees (direction depending on front type and hemisphere) at sea level
    - skewed by 40 degrees over land

## Convergence and divergence
* wind differ nearer land because of convergence and divergence - within 5 miles of coast by about 5%
* this is because wind is slowed by friction on land and is therefore skewed to a larger extent by the Coriolis effect
* where the skew means there is superposition of the land and sea wind speeds, there is convergence
* where the skew means there wind on land is moving in the opposite direction there is divergence
* in addition to this land can affect the wind in other ways:
  - valleys can funnel wind
  - cliffs produce turbulence

## The Beaufort scale
* the Beaufort scale defines seastate and wind speed in a scale
* most important thing for sailing and for safety and comfort is sea state
* Forces:
  1. 1-3 kts - light airs and good sea state
  2. 4-6 kts - light beaze - could get the boats going up wind
  3. - gently breaze
  4. - moderate breeze, (best for sailing) at top might put a reef in
  5. - fresh breeze, (best for sailing), white crests on water, quite lively for sailing, perhaps uncomfortable upwind, would need reefs
  6. 22-27 kts - sea state uncomfortable The point at which the MET office will issue weather warnings
  7. 28-33 - near gale
  8. 34-44 - (gale warning on shipping forecast)
  9. 41-47 - severe gale
  10. - survival conditions (parachute anchor, no sail)
  11. 56-63 - storm
  12. 64 kts upwards - huricane
