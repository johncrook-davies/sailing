# Compasses
* Directions are defined with either 'T' for true, 'M' for magnetic or 'C' for compass in brackets
* 'True virgins Make dull Companions' - TvMdC
  - True -> (apply) variation -> Magnetic -> (apply deviation) -> Compass
  - going from True to Compass with Westerly variation and deviation you add
  - going from True to Compass with Easterly variation and deviation you subtract
  - going from Compass to True with Westerly variation and deviation you subtract
  - going from Compass to True with Easterly variation and deviation you add
## Variation
* Depending where you are on the planet, the variation between true north and magnetic north changes
* The compasses on a chart define the following information:
  - the variation
  - the year that which the variation is defined at
  - the bit in brackets defines the rate of change in variation every year
  - also in the bit in brackets is the direction of change ('E' for East or 'W' for West)
* 'Error West Compass Best, Error East Compass Least'
  - Westerly errors mean the compass always has higher numbers compared to true - so subtract
  - Easterly errors mean that the compass always has a lower number compared to true - so add
* To get to the variation in the current year you need to
  1. use the change multiplied by the rate of change and add to the defined
  2. round the answer to the nearest degree.
## Deviation
* To be treated completely seperately from variation.
* Things like engines, ferrous metals and speakers cause variation in the compass
* Deviation changes depending on the orientation of the boat because of the relative positions of the compass and the magnetic materials on the boat
* This means that the deviation is defined by a curve
* The curve can be plotted by
  - pointing to a known direction, maybe in between two buoys
  - taking the bearing
  - differencing the bearing to the magnetic bearing (after variation has been applied)
