# Notes on sailing

* Universal time is equivalent to GMT



### Tidal stream tables
- Shows direction of tide at high water
- Left number is speed of tide for spring tide in knots
- Right is speed of neap tide in
- 'Tidal diamonds'

## Almanac
* Almanacs are specific to each calendar year
* Inside page shows the chart covered by the almanac
* There's loads of information on the first few pages covering a number of different bits
* The next pages cover abbreviations use in the almanac
* The next pages have tables of lights giving:
  - abreriations
  - lenght of flashes
* The next page has chart symbol definitions (a more comprehensive list can be found in the 5011)
* Next page shows springs etc
* A 'tidal gate' is a place where the tide is very strong which is a problem for slow boats or 'craft'

### Tidal directions
* The next pages show tidal directions
* The first number is the speed at neeps
* The second number is the
### Weather
### Sections
* The first pages have important local information
* Then there are details of the lights in the areas
* Then there are individual sections with more information like
  - berths in harbour
  - where is good anchoring
  - which bits are sheltered
  - pilotage notes - which basically tell you exactly how to pilot into a  harbour eg. Stay port of SCM (south cardinal marker), keep SCM in view in between break waters on approach.
  - depths are all defined as at chart datum
  - radio details - what channel VTS is in, what channel the marina is on (usually 80), what channel is the emergency channel - used for initial contact and maydays (always 16)
  - facilities - a list of facilities ususally all abreviated
* Tidal information 365 days worth including:
  - time zone (UT == GMT) including any adjustments to get to local seasonal time ie. daylight savings time (DST). Times are defined counter intuitively as being minus x hours for timezones that are x hours ahead of UT/GMT. The times in the almanac are as at the timezone stated. For the training charts, containting the Northern Territories and Southern Pensinsula, the defined timezones are UT, NTDST, Time Zone -0100, SPDST
  - times and heights above chart datum
  - On neap days the range is very small (if it's a half moon)
  - On springs days the range is very large (if it's a full moon)
  - Smaller places and less important locations ('secondary ports') have a small table that relates to one of the larger 365 days  
* Tidal height curve
  - For working out the tide at any time of day given the low and high water
  - Mean springs is the average springs tide for the whole year
  - It can be a bell curve or an upside down bell curve depending on whether it is based on the high water or low water tides
### Deviation curve
### Rising/dipping distances
* If you know the height of the light, this is distance at which a light goes from being a 'lume' of light to an actual visible light source
* By taking a fix of the light, you can use these distances to do a fix on the chart
* Heights on the chart are defined as at Mean High Water Springs (MHWS)

## 5011
* This is a comprehensive list of symbols on the charts
* At the back of the book is a load of pictures - here you
 1. find the thing that looks like the symbol you're after
 2. go the pages that are referenced
 3.



## Todo
* Rest of questions up to question 11
