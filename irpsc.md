# International regulations for the provention of collisions during sea (IRPSC) ('Col Regs')

## Assessment of risk of collision
### Using bearings
* working out if there is a risk of collision
  1. using a hand bearing compass take a bearing of the craft of interest
  2. take a second bearing
  3. if the bearing remains constant then we are on a collision course
* considerations for avoiding collisions
  - is the craft so large, and the orientation such that we will lose wind?
### AIS
* most vessels transmit this
* allows us to see:
  - vessels
  - heading
  - speed
  - time at which that information was relevant at
* system looks at dymanics of boats and calculates
  - CPA - closest point of approach, which is the minimum separation (given current course and speed) projected to occur between two craft
  - TCPA - time to CPA
* this shows all vessels that transmit - this is 99% of all vessels but cannot count on it being all of them
### Radar
* MARPA - mini automatic radar plotting aid
* radar measures relative motion - your vessel is always at the centre of the picture

## Important specific rules
* Must know numbers and how to apply these rules
* Rule 5 - whilst underway maintain lookout at all times by sight and all appropriate means for the prevailing conditions (eg. AIS, VHF)
* Rule 9 - in narrow channels:
  a) keep as far to outer limit that is on the starboard side
  b) mustn't impede passage of vessels that can only navigate within channel
  c) vessels engaged in fishing must not impede any vessel
  d) very similar to b...
  e)
    i) use correct sound signals for overtaking
    ii) must still keep out of way of vessel getting overtaken
  f) use one long blast when nearing a bend where visibility is obscured
  g) avoid anchoring in a narrow channel unless absolutely neccessary
* Rule 10
  - obey traffic separation schemes when marked on chart
  - join or leave at termination of lane but when joining in the middle then join from as small an angle as is practically possible
  - avoid crossing but if you do have to cross then cross at a heading (not COG) that is as near as possible to 90 degrees or perpendicular to the direction of the traffic - to ensure that you're across the traffic as quick as possible and presenting an easily interpreted boat aspect to other traffic in the traffic separation scheme
  - only use inshore traffic zone if you're going to or from a port
  - if not crossing or joining don't enter traffic separation 'zone' ( TSZ ie. central reservations) unless:
    - trying to avoid danger
    - fishing
    - ...
  - if crossing you have to turn with the direction of the traffic to avoid collision, you can't turn against
  - RAM is exempt
  - avoid anchoring in the channel separation zone unless in an emergency
  - fishing vessels must stay out of the way of other vessels
* Rule 19 - the conduct of vessels in restricted visibility
  - proceed at a safe speed for prevailing conditions, traffic, proximity to shore
  - have engine ready for menoeuvre
  - if you've detected a vessel by radar alone then you are the give way vessel
    - don't turn towards them
  - if you've heard the fog signal of another vessel, and they are forward of your beam, then reduce speed to the 'minimum stearage way' (minimum speed at which we can still steer)

## Lights and shapes
### Lights
#### Types
* all for night and bad visibility
* white lights (eg. steaming lights) can always be seen from cu
* tricolour light
  - only for craft of <=20m length
  - port, starboard and stern light all in one light
  - arc of visibility 112.5 degrees (22.5 degrees abaft the beam) for port and starboard and 135 degrees for stern light
  - can only be lit under sail
* bicolour light
  - only for craft of <=20m length
  - same as tricolour but without the stern light and at deck level (on the bow), can also be used power driven but must be accompanied by steaming light
* separate port and starboard lights
  - required for sail boats > 20m
  - can be used for sail boats under 20m
  - to be used while under power
* steaming light
  - must be shone under power
  - cannot be shone with tricolour
  - arc of visibility of 225 degrees
  - halfway up mast
#### Rules
* yacht
  - under 20m
    - tricolour or bicolour light, to be lit whilst under sail
    - steaming light to be shone under power
  - over 20m
    - separate port and starboard lights
    - steaming light to be shone under power
* power
  - under 7 and under 7 kts
    - no port and starboard
    - all round white light
  - under 12m
    - all round white light
    - port red and starboard green
    - 112.5 degree port and starboard lights
  - over 12m
    - one 225 degree arc steaming light on a mast
    - 112.5 degree
    - reds and greens and white light separated
  - over 50m
    - two steaming lights with 225 degree arcs on masts, first one lower than second
    - 112.5 degree port and starboard lights often at the back
    - 135 degree stern light
* anchor lights
  - less than 50m - all round white light
  - over 50m - two all round white lights with forward white light being higher one
  - over 100m - there must be some other lights in between the two white lights, these can be as simple as cabin lights etc.
  - no port and starboard lights
### Shapes
* motoring cone (motoring good for stability and also creates extra thrust)
  - upside down triangle
  - for use motor sailing
* anchor ball
  - when at anchor
### Special cases: Vessels engaged
* restricted ability to menouvre (RAM)
  - eg. dredger
  - day shape - ball diamond ball ("if you had a diamond inbetween your balls then you'd be restricted in menouevrability too")
  - lights - red white red in addition to all other required lights
* RAM by dint of being engaged in underwater operations
  - ball diamond ball with two balls on one side - the side where it is not safe to pass and two diamonds on the side that it is safe to pass on
  - red white red central lights and then two reds on the unsafe side and two green lights on the safe side
  - if not making way then craft will show no port/starboard or stern lights
* constrained by draught
  - deep draft relative to where it is sailing eg. Must stay in channel
  - day shape - a black cylinder ("draight keg")
  - lights - three red lights, visible all round, in addition to all other lights
* trawling
  - two triangles pointing towards each other (like a west cardinal)
  - green over white (counts as one steaming light)
* fishing other than trawling
  - two triangles pointing towards each other (like a west cardinal)
  - red over white (counts as one steaming light), the opposite of pilot
* purse seine fishing
  - red over white with two flashing lights on the side where the net is
* towing
  - from stern of pulling boat to stern of tow
  - day shape - under 200m - one diamond, over 200m a diamond on each
  - lights
    - under 200m - two white 225 degree arc lights on top of each other, over 200m three 225 degree arc lights on top of each other
    - from stern yellow over white
    - if the tug is over 50m then there will be an additional steaming light to accompany the 2 or three other steaming lights
* minesweeping
  - day shape - three black balls in a triangle formation
  - lights - three 360 degree green lights
* pilot vessel on duty
  - day shape - white and red flag ('H' or hotel)
  - white over red 360 degree lights - the white counts as a steaming light (the opposite of fishing other than trawling)
  - the pilot vessel at anchor scenario is the only scenario where other lights are shown along side anch
* vessel operating in non-displacement mode (hovering hover craft)
  - flashing yellow light day and night
* diving
  - white and blue swallow tail flag ('A' or flag)
  - might show RAM at night
* not under command (unable to comply with collision regulations)
  - two black balls at day
  - two reds on top of each other, no steaming lights but can determine whether the vessel is making way by the presence of port and starboard lights
  - eg. fault, or lot of windage et.
* aground
  - three black balls (total balls up)
  - two reds, plus the anchor lights

## Right of way
### Hierarchy
#### In open water
1. Not under command
2. Restricted in ability to menoeuvre
4. Fishing/trawling
5. Sailing
6. Power driver
#### In a narrow channel
...
### Giving way
* vessels give way to vessels approaching from their starboard side (just like a UK roundabout)
  - the vessel giving way is the give way vessel - must make course adjustemen in a bold and obvious way
  - the vessel who has the right of way is the 'stand on vessel' - must maintain course and speed and be ready to make adjustments if give way vessel does not move out of the way
  - another way to remember this is that the stand on vessel sees green and the give way vessel sees port
* over taking, no matter where you are in the hierarchy, the overtaking vessel keeps clear
  - the technical definition of overtaking is if the overtaking vessel is within, or would be within, the arc of the stern light (135 degrees)
  - there is no side that you have to overtake on
  - during the day if you're not sure, just assume you are the give way vessel
  - during night if you are in the arc of the stern light then you are the overtaking vessel
* for two vessels sailing
  - the direction that the wind is coming from is the tack that you're on eg. coming from port means you are on a port tack
  - if you are on a broad reach then the wind is assuming to be coming from the opposite direction to the direction your main sail is
  - port gives way to starboard
  - on the same tack the windward (leeward) vessel gives way
* for two vessels heading towards eash other head on
   - both turn to starboard and pass port to port

## Sound signals
* four to six seconds for a long
* 1-2 seconds for a short
* dash - turn to starbourad
* dash dash - to port
* three dash - operating astern propulsion
* five short blasts - make clear your intentions
* long long short - intend to over take to starboard
* long short long short - agree with your intentions to overtake
* long - approaching a blind bind
* long long short short - intend to overtake to port
### Bad visilbility/fog
* four short - pilot vessel
* long - power driven vessel making way
* Long long - power driven vessel underway but stopped
* long short short - all other vessels (lame duck)
* long three short - last vessel of tow if preceded by the previous
* rapid ringing of a bell at intervals not exceeding 1 min - anchored
* rapid ringing of a bell at intervals not exceeding 1 min with rapid gong - anchored and over 100m in length
* small boats just have to make any sort of efficient sound signal
