# International regulations for the provention of collisions during sea (IRPSC) ('Col Regs')

## Assessment of risk of collision
### Using bearings
* working out if there is a risk of collision
  1. using a hand bearing compass take a bearing of the craft of interest
  2. take a second bearing
  3. if the bearing remains constant then we are on a collision course
* considerations for avoiding collisions
  - is the craft so large, and the orientation such that we will lose wind?
### AIS
* most vessels transmit this
* allows us to see:
  - vessels
  - heading
  - speed
  - time at which that information was relevant at
* system looks at dymanics of boats and calculates
  - CPA - closest point of approach, which is the minimum separation (given current course and speed) projected to occur between two craft
  - TCPA - time to CPA
* this shows all vessels that transmit - this is 99% of all vessels but cannot count on it being all of them
### Radar
* MARPA - mini automatic radar plotting aid
* radar measures relative motion - your vessel is always at the centre of the picture

## Lights and shapes
### Lights
#### Types
* all for night and bad visibility
* white lights (eg. steaming lights) can always be seen from cu
* tricolour light
  - only for craft of <=20m length
  - port, starboard and stern light all in one light
  - arc of visibility 112.5 degrees (22.5 degrees abaft the beam) for port and starboard and 135 degrees for stern light
  - can only be lit under sail
* bicolour light
  - only for craft of <=20m length
  - same as tricolour but without the stern light and at deck level (on the bow), can also be used power driven but must be accompanied by steaming light
* steaming light
  - must be shone under power
  - cannot be shone with tricolour
  - arc of visibility of 225 degrees
  - halfway up mast
#### Rules
* yacht under 20m
  - tricolour or bicolour light, to be lit whilst under sail
  - steaming light to be shone under power
* yacht over 20m
  - separate port and starboard lights
  - steaming light to be shone under power
* power under 12m
  - all round white light above red and greens
  - 112.5 degree port and starboard lights
* power over 12m
  - one 225 degree arc steaming light on a mast
  - 112.5 degree
  - reds and greens and white light separated
* power over 50m
  - two steaming lights with 225 degree arcs on masts, first one lower than second
  - 112.5 degree port and starboard lights often at the back
  - 135 degree stearn light
* anchor lights
  - less than 50m - all round white light
  - over 50m - two all round white lights with forward white light being higher one
### Shapes
* motoring cone
  - upside down triangle
  - for use motor sailing
* anchor ball
  - when at anchor
### Special cases: Vessels engaged
* restricted ability to menouvre (RAM)
  - eg. dredger
  - day shape - ball diamond ball ("if you had a diamond inbetween your balls then you'd be restricted in menouevrability too")
  - lights - red white red in addition to all other required lights
* constrained by draught
  - deep draft relative to where it is sailing eg. Must stay in channel
  - day shape - a black cylinder ("draight keg")
  - lights - three red lights, visible all round, in addition to all other lights
* trawling
  - green over white
* fishing other than trawling
  - red over white
* towing
  - from stearn of pulling boat to stern of tow
  - day shape - under 200m - one diamond, over 200m a diamond on each
  - lights
    - under 200m - two white 225 degree arc lights on top of each other, over 200m three 225 degree arc lights on top of each other
    - from stern yellow over white
* minesweeping
  - day shape - three black balls in a triangle formation
  - lights - three 360 degree green lights
* pilot vessel on duty
  - day shape - white and red flag
  - white over red 360 degree lights - the white counts as a steaming light
* vessel operating in non-displacement mode (hovering hover craft)
  - flashing yellow light day and night
* diving
  - white and blue swallow tail flag (A-flag)
* not under command (unable to comply with collision regulations)
  - eg. fault, or lot of windage et.

## Right of way
### Hierarchy
#### In open water
1. Not under command
2. Restricted in ability to menoeuvre
4. Fishing/trawling
5. Sailing
6. Power driver
#### In a narrow channel
...
### Giving way
* vessels give way to vessels approaching from their starboard side (just like a UK roundabout)
  - the vessel giving way is the give way vessel - must make course adjustemen in a bold and obvious way
  - the vessel who has the right of way is the 'stand on vessel' - must maintain course and speed and be ready to make adjustments if give way vessel does not move out of the way
  - another way to remember this is that the stand on vessel sees green and the give way vessel sees port
* over taking, no matter where you are in the hierarchy, the overtaking vessel keeps clear
  - there is no side that you have to overtake on
  - during the day if you're not sure, just assume you are the give way vessel
  - during night if you are in the arc of the stern light then you are the overtaking vessel
* for two vessels sailing
  - the direction that the wind is coming from is the tack that you're on eg. coming from port means you are on a port tack
  - if you are on a broad reach then the wind is assuming to be coming from the opposite direction to the direction your main sail is
  - port gives way to starboard
  - on the same tack the windward (leeward) vessel gives way
