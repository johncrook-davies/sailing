# Anchoring
## How much chain/rope to put out (scope)?
The aim is ensure that there is no vertical pull on the anchor itself, it must remain lateral on the anchor - the vertical pull must be on the cable itself.
Rough rules for how much to put out:
* if using only chain (cable) you put out 4x the maximum expected depth for the duration that you're staying put
* if you use cable and rope (warp) it's 6x
* if there is rough weather or if you are anchoring overnight you might want to put out more than this, or alternatively use two anchors in some combination:
  - tied to the same cable
  - front and stern
  - at some other angle
## Considerations in selecting a place to anchor
* Is it sheltered from
  - wind
  - swell
  - tidal stream
* Bays can sometimes funnel wind and swell which can be bad
* Consider tidal rise and fall
* If the swell is large then this movement will also be an issue for depth
* How much chain to we need to put south
* What is the nature of the sea bed:
  - Mud (M) good
  - Kelp bad - kelp does not stick to sea bed
  - Rock (R) bad - anchor either doesn't stick or will not come unstuck
* Is there 'swinging room' - this is the length of you cable
  - Sailing boads are 'tide rode' ie. Very much affected by tide
  - Motor boats are 'wind rode' ie. Affected by winds
  - This will affect how neighbouring craft move with the tide/wind
  - Will we get tangled with a buoy
* Is the weather forecast going to make conditions unfavourable?
  - Wind 'backs' or changes direction so that the anchorage is no longer sheltered
## Types of anchor (will not be tested for day skipper)
* Delta
  - No moving parts
  - Difficult to stow
  - Good holding
  - Usually stays on the bow roller (the bit on the front)
* Bruce anchor
  - Doesn't hold great
  - The hinged ones do stow well
  - Can be used as a backup (or stern) or a 'kedge' anchor
  - Usually stays on the bow roller
  - Can be had to get out of mud
* CQR or plough
  - Has a hinge connecting shank to other bit
* Fishermans
  - Old school
  - Not seen much these days
  - Fixes quite well to rock
## How to test how well we are holding
* Take a transit
  - best direction to take a transit is the direction that the anchor is likely to drag
  - pick two markers ashore that are pretty well lined up
  - monitor whether the markers increase in separation
  - if the separation increases then you are dragging the anchor
* Put the motor slightly in reverse for a small amount of time
  - if the boat bounces back forwards then the anchor is holding
  - if the boat does not bounce back, the anchor is dragging
* Take a bearing
  - can be used if a transit is not possible
  - pick a single marker on the shore and take the bearing using a hand compass (because difficult to use ships compass for this and also to avoid deviation - though must be away from deviation sources)
  - if the bearing changes then the anchor might be dragging
