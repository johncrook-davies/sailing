# Safety
## Safety briefs
* this depends on how long you are sailing for
* the sorts of things that you might talk about on these are:
  - gas
    - any gas that leaks will end up in bilges, must be careful to not let this build up - there is a gas sensor in the bilge - if there is too much there is a pump
  - fire
    - know how to use fire extinguishers
    - locations of extinguishers, blankets etc.
    - avoid smoking, chip pans
  - life jackets and harnesses
    - there are jackstays for rough weather
    - there are D-rings in the cockpit
    - wear a life jacket at all times
  - flares and emergency ariels
    - if the ariel on the mask breaks there is a spare
  - first aid
    - where the first aid boxes are
    - what is in them
  - heads
    - how to use them
  - sea cocks - where they are and where the wooden bung is
  - VHF radio
    - how to send an emergency alert
  - lifebelts, drogues and danbuoys
    - where they are
    - how to use them
    - are they automatic or not
    - where is the manual pull
    - where is the inflation tube
    - other features, crotch straps, reflective tape, whistle
  - abandonship - what to do
  - engine
    - how to turn it on
    - how to go forward/backwards
  - galley
    - wear oil skin bottoms
  - slips and falls
    - the boom
  - winch safety
    - three turns for safety
    - don't release jammer without taking a turn
    - keep fingers clear
## Emergency position indicating radio beacon (ERIRB) or personal locator beacon (PLB)
* big battery attached to a GPS beacon
* set off when abandoning ship
* sends position to receiving station who can arrange a rescue
* EPIRB lasts around 4 days, PLB lasts around a day or two
## Search and rescue transponder (SART)
* radar transponder
* used by rescuers to locate you
* on radar
  - starts off as dots on a radar
  - becomes lines
  - eventually concentric circles centred on your position
## Personal AIS beacon
* ...
## Radar recfectors
* gives a significant raturn ping
* boat by itself doesn't give a good signiture
## VHF radio
* press and hold distress button for 5s to send DSC alert
* follow up with voice mayday on channel 16
* maydays are to be sent in situations of grave and iminent danger
* voice mayday consists of:
  - M - Mayday x3
  - I - ID x3 MMSI No. and callsign
  - R - repeat MMSI No. and callsign
  - P - position in Lat/Long or if not position from something
  - D - distress - what is the issue
  - A - actions - what are we doing about it
  - N - number of crew
  - I - immediate assistance required
  - O - over
* maydays can always be cancelled
## Emergency distress flares
* kept in waterproof canister
* check they are in date
* red hand held
  - to be used at night
  - very bright
  - to be used within three miles or within sight of a potential rescuer
  - 15,000 candella so can be seen for 15 nautical miles in theory
* red parachute
  - 30,000 candella
  - eject at 300m
  - to be used when out of sight of potential rescue if you know potential rescue is in sight
  - send in pairs so that anyone looking at them can be sure they saw it
  - fire down wind - they fly into wind
  - increase angle if cloudy to make sure it goes off below cloud
* orange smoke
  - for about 3 minutes
  - for helicopters
* there are lots of different mechanisms for flares
* make sure you hold the flare by the handle, maybe keep a glove in the canister
* hold well away
* cannot put in the bin - must give back to manufacturer or coast guard
## Distress singals
* raise and lower both hands
* ball over a square
* SOS by any means
* fog horn
## Abandoning to liferaft
* should be self launching but can be launched by hand
* the last resort - better off in a semi submerged vessel
* sometimes in a bag in a cockpit locker - should be easily accessible
* must be tied on by a painter
* when launching
  - launch down wind (unless a fire is making that difficult)
  - get everyone in life jackets
  - get GPS, compass, fishing equipment, as much stuff as possible
  - send a mayday
  - check painter is tied on
  - launch the liferaft
  - pull on painter to inflate
  - get the heaviest/strongest in there first to stabilise it
  - cut the painter using round-blated knife in raft, stream the sea anchor/drogue to prevent capsize and minimise downwind drift, close the canopy and maintain the canopy (bail out water to keep dry, keep door shut or open to let air in)
  - avoid eating in first 24 hours to put body in starvation mode so it needs less water
  - post a 24hour lookout
* helicopter rescue
  - clear cockpit to reduce chances of snag
  - speak to them as much as possible
  - they will ask you to sail close hauled on a port tack to help them
  - rescuer will drop down on a high line - let this discharge in the water to discharge static
  - after this do as your told
## Tenders/dinghys
* load evenly
* don't overload
* if using an engine, take oars
* wear lifejackets
* take a pump
* take a puncture repair kit
* take a torch
## Kill cords
* always attach
