## General notes
* Universal time is equivalent to GMT

## Boat dynamics
* Heading is the direction that the boat is travelling in
* Bearing is the direction that one thing (could be anything) from another
* Draft is the distance from the water line to the bottom of the keel

* Leigh (or leward) shore is the shore on to which wind is blowing
* Velocity Made Good (VMG) is the speed at which you are going from one point to another given tacks etc.

## Boat dimensions
* 'Air draft' is the height from the water line to the top of the structure, this is relevant when working with vertical clearences
* Every boat has a maximum hull speed (no planing), most of the time this is around 8kts. Planing improves this slightly. The maximum hull speed is dependent on length - longer boats have faster maximum hull speeds.
* terminology for movement
  - under way - not attached to the bottom but not necessarily making progress through the water
  - making way - not attached to the bottom and making progress through the water
* terminology for changing direction
  - heading up
    - turn closer to wind
    - sails pulled in
  - bearing away
    - turn away from wind
    - sails eased out
  - tacking
    - pass bow through direction of wind
    - sails change side
  - gybing
    - pass stern through direction of wind
    - sails change side

* Trip is measured over ground
* Log is always through the water
* Passage plan is the entire journey plan
* Pilotage plan is just the plan for exiting/entering harbour

## 5011
* This is a comprehensive list of symbols on the charts
* At the back of the book is a load of pictures - here you
 1. find the thing that looks like the symbol you're after
 2. go the pages that are referenced

## Wind
* sailing downwind
  - is often faster than sailing upwind in high winds as the boat planes slightly
  - slower in light winds
  - in very high winds, sailing downwind is very fast
* sailing upwind
  - faster in light winds
  - slower than sailing downwind in higher winds
  - in very high winds you have to put a reef in which means that the center of force gets more central which means that you can't sail as close to the wind any more
* terminology for orientation relative to wind
  - close hauled - as close to the wind as possible
  - close reach - not as close to the wind as possible but not sailing perpendicular to direction of wind
  - beam reach - wind roughly perpendicular to direction of travel
  - broad reach - wind off the bow
  - dead run - wind directly on bow, gib/genoa could be opposite side from main sail

# GPS
## Outputs
* Range and bearing fix (taken from waypoint)
  - range and bearing are defined relative to this, range is distance to waypoint and bearing is bearing that must be steered to get there
  - waypoint symbol is a square with a cross through it
  - fix taken from GPS is just as the normal fix - a dot with a circle round it
* Lat and long
  - Try and avoid these as they take quite a long time and they are prone to error
* Range
* Bearing

## Todo
* Do extra questions on tidal height
* Flick throuh day skipper book and come back to session with any questions
* Pages 6 and 7
