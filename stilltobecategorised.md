## General notes
* Universal time is equivalent to GMT

## Boat dynamics
* Heading is the direction that the boat is travelling in
* Bearing is the direction that one thing (could be anything) from another
* Draft is the distance from the water line to the bottom of the keel

* Leigh (or leward) shore is the shore on to which wind is blowing
* Velocity Made Good (VMG) is the speed at which you are going from one point to another given tacks etc.

## Boat dimensions
* 'Air draft' is the height from the water line to the top of the structure, this is relevant when working with vertical clearences

## 5011
* This is a comprehensive list of symbols on the charts
* At the back of the book is a load of pictures - here you
 1. find the thing that looks like the symbol you're after
 2. go the pages that are referenced

# GPS
## Outputs
* Range and bearing fix (taken from waypoint)
  - range and bearing are defined relative to this, range is distance to waypoint and bearing is bearing that must be steared to get there
  - waypoint symbol is a square with a cross through it
  - fix taken from GPS is just as the normal fix - a dot with a circle round it
* Lat and long
  - Try and avoid these as they take quite a long time and they are prone to error
* Range
* Bearing

* Page 13 questions 1 and 2
